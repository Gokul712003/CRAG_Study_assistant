      "    *   **Real-time Processing:** Enables immediate data analysis and response.\n",
      "    *   **Resource Efficiency:** Reduces the load on central servers and optimizes bandwidth usage.\n",
      "    *   **Scalability:** Designed to handle large, distributed systems efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Infrastructure (Hardware & Software):**\n",
      "    *   **Hardware:** Edge computing hardware requires specific design considerations, including low latency, high throughput, modularity and expandability for scalability, and fault tolerance with redundant systems for reliability.\n",
      "    *   **Software:**\n",
      "        *   **Key Components:** This includes operating systems (often Linux-based, such as Ubuntu Core, or RTOS), middleware (edge orchestration platforms like EdgeX Foundry or KubeEdge), and applications (machine learning models, analytics tools).\n",
      "        *   **Software Considerations:** Interoperability with cloud and IoT platforms, security features (data encryption, secure boot, access control), and manageability (remote management, updates, monitoring) are crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Edge Devices and Sensors:**\n",
      "    *   **Edge Devices:** These are the computing devices that process data at the edge, close to the source.\n",
      "    *   **Sensors:** These devices detect and respond to environmental inputs (temperature, pressure, motion, etc.).\n",
      "    *   **Functions:** They handle data collection and preprocessing, make local decisions, and communicate with central servers when necessary.\n",
      "    *   **Importance:** They are critical for real-time data processing, reduced latency, and enhanced security and privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC):**\n",
      "    *   MEC is a network architecture concept that extends cloud computing capabilities and IT service environments to the edge of the network.\n",
